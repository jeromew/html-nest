  "description": "The goal of this module is to apply as much as possible of the HTML5 Tree Construction algorithm (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#tree-construction) to a stream of tokens coming from `html-tokenize`. `html-tokenize` works very well on documents that are properly nested, but it can produce unbalanced tags if the original document has mis-nested tags. The Tree Construction algorithm was specified to allow HTML5 browsers to bypass parsing errors, and build a balanced tree out of any document that 'looks' like an HTML5 document. This module adapts the output of `html-tokenize` with the same algorithm.",
